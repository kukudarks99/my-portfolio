            I have five years of experience developing android, iOS mobile

            I earned two bachelor degrees from Kyung Hee University, Computer
            Engineering and Electronics and Radio Engineering. My first career
            started with the medical IT company. I developed software to assist
            treatment in the hospital and provided software to more than 50
            institutions including university and general hospitals. I also
            successfully led the project by participating in many medical
            conferences and exhibitions.

            In my second career, I was a responsible and reliable developer as a
            key member of SD Enternet mobile game development team. My role was
            to write native code using C++ and run it on Android mobile apps
            using JNI. I customized the applications to work on iOS as well as
            Android, and developed various services using open API functions
            provided by Google, Facebook, and Twitter. In addition, I provided
            services to over 100,000 gamers in five countries without any
            problems. After successfully finishing the project in the SD
            Enternet, I was promoted to team leader and proceeded with the new
            project. I communicated with the game design, app design team and
            carried out the project smoothly.

            Recently, I am working on personal projects using React and
            Javascript because I am interested in not only native applications,
            also web and hybrid applications. I believe my expertises of works
            and interest will contribute to new success as a member of new job.
